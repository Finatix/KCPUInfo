# KCPUInfo
KCPUinfo should be a clone of CPU-Z but running in Linux.

Currently it's in an very early state and show rudimentary CPU information only. The goal of this project will be to show all CPU information as in Windows. 

Besides that, information about the mainboard, the system memory and the operating system should be shown as well.

It is a project under development for which a roadmap is in the works. Will be announced in spring 2023.
